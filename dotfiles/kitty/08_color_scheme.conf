# The foreground and background colors
foreground  #f8f8f2
background  #282a36

# The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is opaque and
# 0 is fully transparent. This will only work if supported by the OS (for
# instance, when using a compositor under X11). Note that it only sets the
# background colorâ€™s opacity in cells that have the same background color as the
# default terminal background. This is so that things like the status bar in
# vim, powerline prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a
# color theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be rendered as
# transparent. Instead you should change the default background color in your
# kitty config and not use a background color in the editor color scheme. Or use
# the escape codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
# launch your editor. Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly
# significant) performance hit. If you want to dynamically change transparency
# of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it
# has a performance cost)
background_opacity 1.0

# Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.
background_image none

# Whether to tile or scale the background image.
background_image_layout tiled

# When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation should be used.
background_image_linear no

# Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either keyboard
# shortcuts (ctrl+shift+a>m and ctrl+shift+a>l) or the remote control facility.
dynamic_background_opacity no

# How much to tint the background image by the background color. The tint is
# applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes it easier to read
# the text. Tinting is done using the current background color for each window.
# This setting applies only if background_opacity is set and transparent windows
# are supported or background_image is set.
background_tint 0.0

# How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One means no
# dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).
dim_opacity 0.75

# The foreground for text selected with the mouse. A value of none means to
# leave the color unchanged.
selection_foreground  #ffffff

# The background for text selected with the mouse.
selection_background  #44475a

# The 16 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a dull and
# bright version. You can also set the remaining colors from the 256 color table
# as color16 to color255.
